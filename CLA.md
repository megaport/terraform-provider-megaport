## Megaport Contributor Licence Agreement  
Version: 20201126

### Summary of CLA  
- Requiring a Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA) is a common and well-accepted practice in open source. 
- This is a summary of the full CLA and highlights only some of the key terms of the CLA.
- You should carefully review all the terms of the full CLA below before contributing.
- Agreeing to a CLA explicitly states that you are entitled to provide a contribution, that you cannot withdraw permission to use your contribution at a later date and that Megaport has your permission to use your contribution.
- By making a contribution, you are not obligating yourself to provide support for the contribution, and you are not taking on any warranty obligations or providing any assurances about how it will perform.

### CLA 
Contributions to any public project are subject to the relevant open source licence agreement, such as Mozilla 2.0. In the event of any inconsistency, the open source licence agreement will take precedence. In order to clarify the intellectual property licence granted with Contributions from any person or entity, Megaport (Services) Pty Ltd (**Megaport**) must have a Contributor Licence Agreement (**CLA**) with that person or entity indicating agreement to the licence terms below.

By signing this CLA, You understand and agree that this project and contributions to it are public and that a record of the contribution (e.g.like Your Github username and timestamp) is maintained indefinitely as part of the public project and may be redistributed consistent therewith.

1. **Grant of Copyright licence**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this CLA, You hereby grant to Megaport and to recipients of software distributed by Megaport a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright licence to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicence, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

1. **Grant of Patent licence**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this CLA, You hereby grant to Megaport a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent licence to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such licence applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licences granted to that entity under this CLA for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

1. **Trademarks**. This Licence does not grant You permission to use Megaport’s trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Contributions.

1. **Representations**. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above licence. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that you will have received permission from your current and future employers for all future Contributions, that your applicable employer has waived such rights for all of your current and future Contributions to Megaport, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Megaport.  

    You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party licence or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.  

    You agree to notify Megaport of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

1. **Support**. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent that You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all.


1. **Liability**. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, you provide your contributions on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of title, non- infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

### Definitions

1. **"Contribution"** shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is or previously has been intentionally submitted by You to Megaport for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Megaport (the "Work").

    For the purposes of this definition, **"submitted"** means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Megaport or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Megaport for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Contribution”.

1. **"You" (or "Your")** shall **mean** the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this CLA with Megaport. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
