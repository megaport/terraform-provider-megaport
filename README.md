# Megaport Terraform Provider

The `terraform-provider-megaport` or Megaport Terraform Provider lets you create and manage
Megaport's product and services using the [Megaport API](https://dev.megaport.com).

This prdata "megaport_cloud_port_lookup" "gcp_secure" {
connect_type = "GOOGLE"
include_secure = true
secure_key = var.gcp_pairing_key
location_id = 123
}

# Oracle with service key

data "megaport_cloud_port_lookup" "oracle_secure" {
connect_type = "ORACLE"
include_secure = true
secure_key = var.oracle_service_key
location_id = 123
}rtunity for true multi-cloud hybrid environments supported by Megaport's Software
Defined Network (SDN). Using the Terraform provider, you can create and manage Ports,
Virtual Cross Connects (VXCs), Megaport Cloud Routers (MCRs), Megaport Virtual Edges (MVEs), and Partner VXCs.

This provider is compatible with HashiCorp Terraform, and we have tested compatibility with OpenTofu and haven't seen issues.

The Megaport Terraform Provider is released as a tool for use with the Megaport API.

**Important:** The usage of the Megaport Terraform Provider constitutes your acceptance of the terms available
in the Megaport [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.megaport.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy/) and
[Global Services Agreement](https://www.megaport.com/legal/global-services-agreement/).

## Documentation

Documentation is published on the [Terraform Provider Megaport](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/megaport/megaport/latest/docs) registry and the [OpenTofu Provider Megaport](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/megaport/megaport/latest) registry.

## Installation

### Terraform Installation

The preferred installation method is via the [Terraform Provider Megaport](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/megaport/megaport/latest/docs)
registry.

### OpenTofu Installation

For OpenTofu users, the provider is available via the [OpenTofu Registry](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/megaport/megaport/latest). No configuration changes are needed - use the same provider source as you would with Terraform.

## Configuration

The provider can be configured in the same way whether using HashiCorp Terraform or OpenTofu:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    megaport = {
      source  = "megaport/megaport"
      version = "~> 1.3"
    }
  }
}

provider "megaport" {
  # Configuration options
  environment           = "production"
  access_key            = "your-access-key"
  secret_key            = "your-secret-key"
  accept_purchase_terms = true
}
```

## üö® NEW FEATURE: MCR Prefix Filter List Resources

### Enhanced MCR Management with Standalone Resources

The Megaport Terraform Provider now supports managing MCR prefix filter lists as individual resources, providing better lifecycle management and improved state handling compared to the previous inline approach.

#### ‚úÖ New Standalone Approach (Recommended)

```terraform
# Create MCR without inline prefix filter lists
resource "megaport_mcr" "example" {
  product_name         = "my-mcr"
  port_speed          = 1000
  location_id         = 5
  contract_term_months = 12
}

# Manage prefix filter lists as individual resources
resource "megaport_mcr_prefix_filter_list" "allow_private_ipv4" {
  mcr_id         = megaport_mcr.example.product_uid
  description    = "Allow private IPv4 networks"
  address_family = "IPv4"

  entries = [
    {
      action = "permit"
      prefix = "10.0.0.0/8"
      ge     = 16
      le     = 24
    },
    {
      action = "permit"
      prefix = "192.168.0.0/16"
      ge     = 24
      le     = 32
    }
  ]
}

resource "megaport_mcr_prefix_filter_list" "allow_private_ipv6" {
  mcr_id         = megaport_mcr.example.product_uid
  description    = "Allow private IPv6 networks"
  address_family = "IPv6"

  entries = [
    {
      action = "permit"
      prefix = "fd00::/8"
      ge     = 48
      le     = 64
    }
  ]
}
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated Inline Approach

```terraform
# ‚ùå DEPRECATED: Inline prefix filter lists (will be removed in future version)
resource "megaport_mcr" "deprecated_example" {
  product_name         = "my-mcr"
  port_speed          = 1000
  location_id         = 5
  contract_term_months = 12

  # This approach is deprecated and will show warnings
  prefix_filter_lists = [
    {
      description    = "Allow private networks"
      address_family = "IPv4"
      entries = [
        {
          action = "permit"
          prefix = "10.0.0.0/8"
          ge     = 16
          le     = 24
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Benefits of Standalone Resources

- **Individual Lifecycle Management**: Each prefix filter list has its own Terraform state and lifecycle
- **Better Error Handling**: Failures in one list don't affect others
- **Enhanced Reusability**: Lists can be referenced and managed independently
- **Cleaner State**: Avoid complex nested object handling in Terraform state
- **Import Support**: Easy migration of existing lists using `terraform import`

### Migration Guide

#### Step 1: Inventory Existing Lists

Use the data source to see what prefix filter lists you currently have:

```terraform
data "megaport_mcr_prefix_filter_lists" "existing" {
  mcr_id = "your-mcr-uid-here"
}

output "current_lists" {
  value = data.megaport_mcr_prefix_filter_lists.existing.prefix_filter_lists
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Standalone Resources

For each existing list, create a corresponding resource:

```terraform
resource "megaport_mcr_prefix_filter_list" "migrated_list_1" {
  mcr_id         = "your-mcr-uid-here"
  description    = "Copy description from existing list"
  address_family = "IPv4"
  entries = [
    # Copy entries from existing configuration
  ]
}
```

#### Step 3: Import Existing Lists

Import each existing list to avoid recreation:

```bash
terraform import megaport_mcr_prefix_filter_list.migrated_list_1 mcr-uid:prefix-list-id
```

#### Step 4: Update MCR Resource

Remove the `prefix_filter_lists` attribute from your MCR resource and add a lifecycle rule:

```terraform
resource "megaport_mcr" "example" {
  product_name         = "my-mcr"
  port_speed          = 1000
  location_id         = 5
  contract_term_months = 12

  # Remove or comment out the old prefix_filter_lists attribute
  # prefix_filter_lists = [...]

  # Add lifecycle rule to prevent drift warnings
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [prefix_filter_lists]
  }
}
```

#### Step 5: Verify Migration

Run `terraform plan` to ensure no unexpected changes are detected.

### Mixed Usage Prevention

The provider includes validation to prevent managing the same prefix filter lists through both methods simultaneously. If you attempt to use both inline and standalone management for the same MCR, you'll receive warnings about potential conflicts.

### Deprecation Notice

The inline `prefix_filter_lists` attribute in the MCR resource is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. We recommend migrating to standalone `megaport_mcr_prefix_filter_list` resources for better lifecycle management and improved state handling.

### Troubleshooting and Best Practices

#### Common Issues

**MCR Resource Shows Drift with Standalone Resources**

When using standalone `megaport_mcr_prefix_filter_list` resources, you should add a lifecycle rule to your MCR resource to prevent Terraform from detecting drift on the `prefix_filter_lists` attribute. This is necessary because:

1. The standalone prefix filter list resources manage the lists independently
2. The MCR resource still reads the lists from the API, which can cause Terraform to detect "changes" even though the lists are being managed by the standalone resources
3. This applies to both newly created MCRs and existing ones - the lifecycle rule tells Terraform to ignore differences in this attribute since it's being managed elsewhere

```terraform
resource "megaport_mcr" "example" {
  # ... configuration ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [prefix_filter_lists]
  }
}
```

**Why is this needed for new resources?** Even when creating a new MCR alongside standalone prefix filter list resources, Terraform's refresh cycle will detect that the MCR has prefix filter lists attached (via the standalone resources), and without the lifecycle rule, it may show these as unexpected changes on subsequent plan/apply operations.

**Mixed Usage Warning**

If you see warnings about mixed usage, ensure you're not managing the same prefix filter lists through both inline and standalone methods simultaneously.

**Import Format**

When importing existing prefix filter lists, use the format `mcr_uid:prefix_list_id`:

```bash
# Get the MCR UID and prefix list ID from the Megaport Portal or API
terraform import megaport_mcr_prefix_filter_list.example a1b2c3d4-5678-90ef-ghij-klmnopqrstuv:1234
```

#### Best Practices

- **Use Location IDs**: Always use location IDs instead of names for MCR placement (more stable)
- **Validate Prefix Ranges**: Ensure ge (greater than or equal) and le (less than or equal) values make sense for your prefix lengths
- **Group Related Lists**: Create logically grouped prefix filter lists for easier management
- **Test Migrations**: Always test migrations in a non-production environment first
- **Document Purposes**: Use descriptive names and descriptions for prefix filter lists

#### Example Production Configuration

```terraform
# Production MCR with standalone prefix filter lists
resource "megaport_mcr" "production" {
  product_name         = "prod-mcr"
  port_speed          = 2500
  location_id         = 1  # Use stable location ID
  contract_term_months = 12

  resource_tags = {
    Environment = "production"
    Owner       = "network-team"
    Purpose     = "multi-cloud-connectivity"
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [prefix_filter_lists]
  }
}

# Allow internal corporate networks
resource "megaport_mcr_prefix_filter_list" "corporate_networks" {
  mcr_id         = megaport_mcr.production.product_uid
  description    = "Corporate internal networks"
  address_family = "IPv4"

  entries = [
    {
      action = "permit"
      prefix = "10.100.0.0/16"
      ge     = 24
      le     = 28
    },
    {
      action = "permit"
      prefix = "10.200.0.0/16"
      ge     = 24
      le     = 28
    }
  ]
}

# Allow cloud provider networks
resource "megaport_mcr_prefix_filter_list" "cloud_networks" {
  mcr_id         = megaport_mcr.production.product_uid
  description    = "AWS and Azure networks"
  address_family = "IPv4"

  entries = [
    {
      action = "permit"
      prefix = "172.16.0.0/12"
      ge     = 16
      le     = 24
    }
  ]
}

# IPv6 support for future expansion
resource "megaport_mcr_prefix_filter_list" "ipv6_networks" {
  mcr_id         = megaport_mcr.production.product_uid
  description    = "IPv6 corporate networks"
  address_family = "IPv6"

  entries = [
    {
      action = "permit"
      prefix = "2001:db8:100::/48"
      ge     = 56
      le     = 64
    }
  ]
}
```

## Local Development

### Set up a Go workspace

You don't need to do this if you're not modifying `megaportgo`, but if you need to modify it you can use a Go workspace to make this process easier. Take a look at [this tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces) first to get familiar with how Go workspaces work, then create a workspace for local development. This will let you edit the megaportgo library while working on the Terraform Provider without needing to publish changes to Git or modify your go.mod file in the Terraform Provider with a replace statement.

```go.work
go 1.22.0
use (
	./megaportgo
	./terraform-provider-megaport
)
```

### Allow the provider to be run locally

First, find the GOBIN path where Go installs your binaries. Your path may vary depending on how your Go environment variables are configured.

```bash
$ go env GOBIN
/Users/<Username>/go/bin
```

If the GOBIN Go environment variable is not set, use the default path, `/Users/<Username>/go/bin`

Create a new file called `.terraformrc` in your home directory (~), then add the `dev_overrides` block below. Change the `<PATH>` to the value returned from the `go env GOBIN` command above.

```terraform
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
      "registry.terraform.io/megaport/megaport" = "<PATH>"
  }
  # For all other providers, install them directly from their origin provider
  # registries as normal. If you omit this, Terraform will _only_ use
  # the dev_overrides block, and so no other providers will be available.
  direct {}
}
```

Once you‚Äôve done that you can test out changes to the provider by installing it with

```bash
go install .
```

inside of the `terraform-provider-megaport` folder

## üö® BREAKING CHANGE: Location Data Source Migration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT: `site_code` Filtering No Longer Supported

**If you are using `site_code` to filter locations in your Terraform configurations, you must update your code immediately or your configurations will fail.**

The Megaport Location API has been upgraded to v3, and several important changes affect how you interact with location data:

#### ‚ùå What No Longer Works

```terraform
# THIS WILL FAIL - site_code filtering is no longer supported
data "megaport_location" "broken_example" {
  site_code = "NTT-TOK"  # ‚ùå This will cause an error
}
```

#### ‚úÖ What You Should Use Instead

```terraform
# ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED: Use location ID for most reliable results
data "megaport_location" "recommended" {
  id = 123  # IDs never change and are the most stable
}

# ‚úÖ ALTERNATIVE: Use location name (may change over time)
data "megaport_location" "alternative" {
  name = "NextDC B1"  # Names can change, but currently supported
}

# üí° TIP: Save the location ID for future use
output "location_id_for_nextdc_b1" {
  value = data.megaport_location.alternative.id
  description = "Location ID for NextDC B1 - save this for consistent future references"
}

# Then use the saved ID in future configurations:
# data "megaport_location" "stable_reference" {
#   id = 5  # Use the ID from the output above
# }
```

### üîß Migration Guide

**Step 1: Identify affected configurations**
Search your Terraform files for any usage of `site_code`:

```bash
grep -r "site_code" *.tf
```

**Step 2: Replace with `id` or `name`**

- **Best option**: Replace with the location `id` (most stable)
- **Alternative**: Replace with the location `name` (may change over time)

**Step 3: Update deprecated field usage**
Several location fields are now deprecated and will show warnings:

```terraform
# These fields are deprecated and will show warnings:
# - site_code (also no longer available for filtering)
# - campus
# - network_region
# - live_date
# - v_router_available
```

### üìã Complete Migration Checklist

- [ ] Replace all `site_code = "..."` filters with `id = ...` or `name = "..."`
- [ ] Remove any code that depends on deprecated fields
- [ ] Test your configurations thoroughly
- [ ] Update any documentation or comments

### üÜò Need Help?

If you need to find the location ID for a specific site code, you can:

1. **Use Terraform data source**: Query by name to get the ID:

   ```terraform
   data "megaport_location" "lookup" {
     name = "Your Location Name"
   }

   output "location_id" {
     value = data.megaport_location.lookup.id
   }
   ```

2. **Use the API directly**: Call `GET /v3/locations` to see all available locations
3. **Contact Support**: Megaport support can help map site codes to location IDs

---

## Datacenter Location Data Source

Locations for Megaport Data Centers can be retrieved using the Locations Data Source in the Megaport Terraform Provider.

**Current supported search methods:**

- `id` - **RECOMMENDED** (most reliable and stable)
- `name` - Alternative option (may change over time)

Examples:

```terraform
# ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED: Use ID for most reliable results
data "megaport_location" "stable_example" {
  id = 5
}

# ‚úÖ ALTERNATIVE: Use name (less stable, may change)
data "megaport_location" "name_example" {
  name = "NextDC B1"
}

# üí° TIP: Save the location ID for future use
output "location_id_for_nextdc_b1" {
  value = data.megaport_location.name_example.id
  description = "Location ID for NextDC B1 - save this for consistent future references"
}
```

**Important:** Location IDs never change and provide the most reliable and deterministic behavior. Location names may be updated over time, which could cause Terraform configurations to break unexpectedly.

The most up-to-date listing of Megaport Datacenter Locations can be accessed through the Megaport API at `GET /v3/locations`

## Partner Port Selection & Stability

When connecting to cloud service providers, you need to select the appropriate partner ports. Megaport provides two data sources for this purpose:

### Recommended: Cloud Port Lookup Data Source

The **`megaport_cloud_port_lookup`** data source is the recommended approach for selecting partner ports. It addresses common issues with partner port selection by:

- **Returning all matching ports** instead of just one, giving you full visibility and control
- **Supporting secure partner ports** for GCP, Oracle, and Azure connections requiring keys
- **Providing proper validation** with clear error messages for connect types
- **Eliminating confusing warnings** by letting you choose the specific port you want

```terraform
# Find all available AWS ports and choose the best one
data "megaport_cloud_port_lookup" "aws_ports" {
  connect_type   = "AWSHC"
  company_name   = "AWS"
  location_id    = 123
  diversity_zone = "blue"
}

# Select based on your criteria - no more guessing!
locals {
  # Option 1: Use the first available port
  selected_port = data.megaport_cloud_port_lookup.aws_ports.ports[0]

  # Option 2: Choose by name pattern
  preferred_port = [
    for port in data.megaport_cloud_port_lookup.aws_ports.ports :
    port if can(regex("us-east-1", lower(port.product_name)))
  ][0]

  # Option 3: Select by lowest rank (best performance)
  best_port = [
    for port in data.megaport_cloud_port_lookup.aws_ports.ports :
    port if port.rank == min([for p in data.megaport_cloud_port_lookup.aws_ports.ports : p.rank]...)
  ][0]
}

resource "megaport_vxc" "aws_connection" {
  b_end = {
    requested_product_uid = local.selected_port.product_uid
  }
  # ... other configuration
}
```

#### Secure Partner Ports

For cloud providers requiring keys (GCP, Oracle, Azure):

```terraform
# GCP with pairing key
data "megaport_cloud_port_lookup" "gcp_secure" {
  connect_type   = "GOOGLE"
  include_secure = true
  service_key    = var.gcp_pairing_key
  location_id    = 123
}

# Oracle with service key
data "megaport_cloud_port_lookup" "oracle_secure" {
  connect_type   = "ORACLE"
  include_secure = true
  service_key    = var.oracle_service_key
  location_id    = 123
}
```

### Legacy: Partner Data Source

The `megaport_partner` data source is still supported but has limitations:

**Issues with the legacy approach:**

- Returns only one port with potential warnings if multiple matches are found
- No support for secure partner ports
- Less control over port selection
- Partner port UIDs may change over time as Megaport manages capacity, leading to unexpected warnings:

```
Warning: VXC B-End product UID is from a partner port, therefore it will not be changed.
```

**If you must use the legacy data source**, you can prevent warnings by explicitly specifying the `product_uid` once your connections are established:

```terraform
# Initial setup - use standard filtering
data "megaport_partner" "awshc" {
  connect_type    = "AWSHC"
  company_name    = "AWS"
  product_name    = "US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)"
  diversity_zone  = "blue"
  location_id     = 123
}

# After connections are established, update to use explicit product_uid
data "megaport_partner" "awshc" {
  product_uid     = "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ef-ghij-klmnopqrstuv"
  # Keep other filters for documentation purposes
}
```

### Migration Recommendation

**We strongly recommend migrating from `megaport_partner` to `megaport_cloud_port_lookup`** for new configurations. The new data source provides better reliability, clearer error handling, and support for modern cloud connectivity patterns.

## Cloud Port Lookup Data Source Reference

### Configuration

The `megaport_cloud_port_lookup` data source accepts the following arguments:

#### Optional Arguments

- `connect_type` (String) - Connection type. Must be one of: `AWS`, `AWSHC`, `AZURE`, `GOOGLE`, `ORACLE`, `IBM`, `OUTSCALE`, `TRANSIT`, `FRANCEIX`
- `location_id` (Number) - Filter by location ID
- `diversity_zone` (String) - Filter by diversity zone: `red` or `blue`
- `company_name` (String) - Filter by company name
- `vxc_permitted` (Boolean) - Filter by VXC permission (default: `true`)
- `include_secure` (Boolean) - Include secure partner ports (default: `false`)
- `secure_key` (String, Sensitive) - Required for secure ports when `include_secure = true`. Only valid with `connect_type` of `GOOGLE`, `AZURE`, or `ORACLE` (pairing key for GCP, service key for Azure/Oracle)

#### Computed Attributes

- `ports` (List) - Array of ALL matching ports. Use Terraform expressions to filter and select the specific port you need, each containing:
  - `product_uid` (String) - Port unique identifier
  - `product_name` (String) - Port name
  - `connect_type` (String) - Connection type
  - `company_uid` (String) - Company unique identifier
  - `company_name` (String) - Company name
  - `diversity_zone` (String) - Diversity zone
  - `location_id` (Number) - Location ID
  - `speed` (Number) - Port speed in Mbps
  - `rank` (Number) - Port rank (lower = better)
  - `vxc_permitted` (Boolean) - VXC permission status
  - `is_secure` (Boolean) - Whether port requires a key
  - `secure_key` (String, Sensitive) - Key for secure ports (pairing key for GCP, service key for Azure/Oracle)
  - `vlan` (Number) - VLAN ID (secure ports only)

### Advanced Usage Patterns

#### Error Handling and Validation

```terraform
data "megaport_cloud_port_lookup" "aws_ports" {
  connect_type = "AWS"
  location_id  = 3
}

# Validate ports are available
locals {
  has_ports = length(data.megaport_cloud_port_lookup.aws_ports.ports) > 0
}

# Use check blocks (Terraform 1.5+)
check "ports_available" {
  assert {
    condition = local.has_ports
    error_message = "No AWS ports available in location 3"
  }
}

# Conditional resource creation
resource "megaport_vxc" "conditional_connection" {
  count = local.has_ports ? 1 : 0
  # ... configuration
}
```

#### Multi-Region Deployments

```terraform
# Define regions
locals {
  regions = {
    primary = { location_id = 3, diversity_zone = "red" }
    backup  = { location_id = 5, diversity_zone = "blue" }
  }
}

# Get ports for each region
data "megaport_cloud_port_lookup" "aws_ports" {
  for_each = local.regions

  connect_type   = "AWSHC"
  location_id    = each.value.location_id
  diversity_zone = each.value.diversity_zone
}

# Create connections for each region
resource "megaport_vxc" "aws_connections" {
  for_each = local.regions

  product_name = "AWS-${each.key}"
  # ... configuration

  b_end = {
    requested_product_uid = data.megaport_cloud_port_lookup.aws_ports[each.key].ports[0].product_uid
  }
}
```

## Migration from megaport_partner

### Quick Migration Steps

1. **Replace data source name**: `megaport_partner` ‚Üí `megaport_cloud_port_lookup`
2. **Update attribute access**: Add `.ports[0]` to access the first port
3. **Add validation**: Check port availability before use
4. **Update secure connections**: Use `include_secure` and `secure_key`

### Migration Examples

#### Basic Migration

**Before:**

```terraform
data "megaport_partner" "aws_port" {
  connect_type = "AWS"
  location_id  = 3
}

resource "megaport_vxc" "connection" {
  b_end = {
    requested_product_uid = data.megaport_partner.aws_port.product_uid
  }
}
```

**After:**

```terraform
data "megaport_cloud_port_lookup" "aws_ports" {
  connect_type = "AWS"
  location_id  = 3
}

resource "megaport_vxc" "connection" {
  b_end = {
    requested_product_uid = data.megaport_cloud_port_lookup.aws_ports.ports[0].product_uid
  }
}
```

#### Secure Connection Migration

**Before (not possible):**

```terraform
# Secure connections required hardcoded UIDs
resource "megaport_vxc" "gcp_connection" {
  b_end = {
    requested_product_uid = "hardcoded-gcp-port-uid"
  }
  service_key = var.gcp_pairing_key
}
```

**After:**

```terraform
data "megaport_cloud_port_lookup" "gcp_secure" {
  connect_type   = "GOOGLE"
  include_secure = true
  secure_key     = var.gcp_pairing_key
  location_id    = 3
}

resource "megaport_vxc" "gcp_connection" {
  b_end = {
    requested_product_uid = data.megaport_cloud_port_lookup.gcp_secure.ports[0].product_uid
  }
  service_key = var.gcp_pairing_key
}
```

#### Shared Port Selection

**Before:**

```terraform
data "megaport_partner" "aws_port" {
  connect_type = "AWS"
  location_id  = 3
}

# Multiple resources using same port
resource "megaport_vxc" "connection_1" {
  b_end = { requested_product_uid = data.megaport_partner.aws_port.product_uid }
}

resource "megaport_vxc" "connection_2" {
  b_end = { requested_product_uid = data.megaport_partner.aws_port.product_uid }
}
```

**After:**

```terraform
data "megaport_cloud_port_lookup" "aws_ports" {
  connect_type = "AWS"
  location_id  = 3
}

locals {
  selected_aws_port = data.megaport_cloud_port_lookup.aws_ports.ports[0].product_uid
}

resource "megaport_vxc" "connection_1" {
  b_end = { requested_product_uid = local.selected_aws_port }
}

resource "megaport_vxc" "connection_2" {
  b_end = { requested_product_uid = local.selected_aws_port }
}
```

## End-of-Term Cancellation

By default, when Terraform deletes resources, they are immediately cancelled in the Megaport portal. However, you may prefer to have resources marked for cancellation at the end of their current billing term instead of immediate cancellation.

The provider supports this with the `cancel_at_end_of_term` configuration option:

```terraform
provider "megaport" {
  environment           = "production"
  access_key            = "your-access-key"
  secret_key            = "your-secret-key"
  accept_purchase_terms = true
  cancel_at_end_of_term = true  # Mark resources for end-of-term cancellation
}
```

**Important notes:**

- This feature is currently only supported for Single Ports and LAG Ports
- For other resource types, the option will be ignored and immediate cancellation will occur
- When `cancel_at_end_of_term` is set to `true`, resources will show as "CANCELLING" in the Megaport portal until the end of their billing term
- Resources are removed from Terraform state as soon as the API call returns successfully, regardless of whether immediate or end-of-term cancellation is used
- If you reapply your configuration after a resource has been deleted, Terraform will create a new resource, even if the original resource is still visible in the Megaport portal with "CANCELLING" status

## Safe Delete Protection

The Megaport Terraform Provider includes automatic **Safe Delete Protection** to prevent accidental deletion of resources that have active dependencies. This feature is always enabled and works at the API level to protect your infrastructure.

### What is Safe Delete?

Safe Delete is a built-in safety mechanism that prevents you from deleting Ports, MCRs (Megaport Cloud Routers), or MVEs (Megaport Virtual Edge) that have VXCs (Virtual Cross Connects) attached to them. This prevents accidental service disruptions caused by deleting infrastructure that is actively in use.

### How It Works

When you attempt to delete a resource using Terraform:

1. The provider sends a delete request with the `safeDelete=true` parameter
2. The Megaport API checks if the resource has any attached VXCs
3. If VXCs are attached, the API returns an error and **prevents the deletion**
4. If no VXCs are attached, the deletion proceeds normally

### Protected Resources

Safe Delete protection applies to:

- **Single Ports** - Physical network ports
- **LAG Ports** - Link Aggregation Group ports
- **MCRs** - Megaport Cloud Routers
- **MVEs** - Megaport Virtual Edge instances

### Example Scenario

```terraform
# Create a port
resource "megaport_port" "my_port" {
  product_name = "My Production Port"
  port_speed   = 10000
  location_id  = 123
  contract_term_months = 12
  marketplace_visibility = false
}

# Create a VXC attached to the port
resource "megaport_vxc" "my_vxc" {
  product_name = "My VXC"
  rate_limit   = 1000

  a_end {
    requested_product_uid = megaport_port.my_port.product_uid
  }

  b_end {
    requested_product_uid = megaport_mcr.my_mcr.product_uid
  }
}
```

If you try to run `terraform destroy -target=megaport_port.my_port` while the VXC is still attached, the operation will fail with an error:

```
Error: Could not delete port, unexpected error: Cannot delete product with active VXCs attached
```

### Proper Deletion Order

To successfully delete resources with dependencies, delete them in the correct order:

1. **First**: Delete all VXCs attached to the resource
2. **Then**: Delete the Port, MCR, or MVE

```bash
# Correct order for targeted deletions
terraform destroy -target=megaport_vxc.my_vxc      # Delete VXC first
terraform destroy -target=megaport_port.my_port    # Then delete the port

# Or simply destroy everything (Terraform handles dependencies automatically)
terraform destroy
```

When you run a full `terraform destroy`, Terraform automatically determines the correct deletion order based on resource dependencies, so you don't need to worry about the order.

### Benefits

Safe Delete protection provides several benefits:

- **Prevents service disruptions** - Can't accidentally delete infrastructure carrying active traffic
- **Enforces proper cleanup** - Forces you to delete VXCs before their parent resources
- **Automatic protection** - No configuration needed, always enabled
- **Clear error messages** - Tells you exactly why deletion failed

### Difference from Lifecycle Prevent Destroy

Safe Delete protection is different from Terraform's `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` feature:

| Feature                       | Level        | When It Protects                               | Configuration Required |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Safe Delete**               | API/Provider | When resource has attached VXCs                | None (always enabled)  |
| **Lifecycle prevent_destroy** | Terraform    | Always prevents deletion of specific resources | Yes (per resource)     |

**Safe Delete** is automatic dependency protection, while **lifecycle prevent_destroy** is optional protection for critical resources you specifically designate.

For more information about using lifecycle blocks to protect critical resources, see the [prevent_destroy example](examples/prevent_destroy/).

## Protecting Critical Resources with Lifecycle Prevent Destroy

In addition to the automatic Safe Delete protection, you can use Terraform's `lifecycle` block with `prevent_destroy = true` to explicitly protect critical production resources from accidental deletion.

### When to Use Prevent Destroy

Use `prevent_destroy` for resources that are critical to your infrastructure and should never be accidentally deleted:

- Production ports carrying live traffic
- MCRs routing traffic between multiple cloud providers
- VXCs connecting to critical services
- Any resource that would be expensive or time-consuming to recreate

### Example Usage

```terraform
resource "megaport_port" "production_port" {
  product_name           = "Production Port - Protected"
  port_speed             = 10000
  location_id            = data.megaport_location.my_location.id
  contract_term_months   = 12
  marketplace_visibility = false

  # Lifecycle block to prevent accidental destruction
  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "megaport_mcr" "production_mcr" {
  product_name         = "Production MCR - Protected"
  location_id          = data.megaport_location.my_location.id
  contract_term_months = 12

  # Lifecycle block to prevent accidental destruction
  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "megaport_vxc" "production_vxc" {
  product_name         = "Production VXC - Protected"
  rate_limit           = 1000
  contract_term_months = 12

  a_end {
    requested_product_uid = megaport_port.production_port.product_uid
  }

  b_end {
    requested_product_uid = megaport_mcr.production_mcr.product_uid
  }

  # Lifecycle block to prevent accidental destruction
  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```

### How It Works

When you add `prevent_destroy = true` to a resource:

- ‚úÖ Terraform allows creation and updates to the resource
- ‚ùå Terraform refuses to destroy the resource via `terraform destroy`
- ‚ùå Terraform refuses to destroy the resource when it's removed from configuration
- ‚ùå Terraform refuses targeted destroy attempts with `-target`

If you attempt to destroy a protected resource, Terraform will fail with an error:

```
Error: Instance cannot be destroyed

Resource megaport_port.production_port has lifecycle.prevent_destroy set,
but the plan calls for this resource to be destroyed.
```

### Removing Protection

To destroy a protected resource:

1. Remove the `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` block from your configuration
2. Run `terraform apply` to update the configuration
3. Run `terraform destroy` to destroy the resource

### Best Practices

- **Apply to all production resources** - Add `prevent_destroy` to all critical infrastructure
- **Document protection reasons** - Use comments to explain why resources are protected
- **Combine with Portal locking** - Use Megaport Portal's [service locking feature](https://docs.megaport.com/portal-admin/locking/) for additional protection
- **Use version control** - Track changes to lifecycle blocks in Git and require code review
- **Separate environments** - Use different Terraform workspaces for production and non-production resources

### Comparison of Protection Features

| Feature             | Protection Level | When It Activates               | Configuration              |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Safe Delete**     | API/Provider     | When resource has attached VXCs | Automatic (always enabled) |
| **prevent_destroy** | Terraform        | For any deletion attempt        | Manual (per resource)      |
| **Portal Locking**  | Megaport Portal  | Prevents all modifications      | Manual (via Portal)        |
