# 6WIND Megaport Virtual Edge (MVE)

This guide provides an example configuration for deploying a 6WIND Megaport Virtual Edge (MVE).

## Important Requirements

### SSH Key Requirements

6WIND MVE **requires a 2048-bit RSA SSH key**. Other key types such as ED25519, ECDSA, or RSA keys with different bit lengths (1024, 4096) are **not supported** and will cause provisioning failures.

To generate a compatible SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

After generation, use the content of the `.pub` file (your public key) in the `ssh_public_key` field of the `vendor_config`.

### vNIC Configuration

6WIND MVE supports up to 5 vNICs. The network interfaces in the guest OS are named:
- `ens4` (first vNIC)
- `ens5` (second vNIC)
- `ens6` (third vNIC)
- `ens7` (fourth vNIC)
- `ens8` (fifth vNIC)

You can configure between 1 and 5 vNICs depending on your networking requirements. The examples below demonstrate both static and dynamic vNIC configuration approaches.

## Example Configuration

This example configuration creates a 6WIND MVE with both static and dynamic vNIC configurations.
