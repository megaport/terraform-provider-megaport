# megaport_user (Resource)

Megaport User resource for managing users in your company. **User Lifecycle**: When created, users have a pending invitation status. Users with pending invitations can be updated minimally and deleted completely. Once a user accepts their invitation and logs in, they can be fully updated but can only be deactivated (not deleted) via Terraform. The provider automatically handles the appropriate deletion/deactivation behavior based on the user's invitation status.

## Schema

### Required

- `email` (String) The primary email address of the user. **Important**: The email address cannot be changed after user creation. Changing this value will force Terraform to destroy and recreate the user resource.
- `first_name` (String) The first name of the user.
- `last_name` (String) The last name of the user.
- `position` (String) The position/role of the user in the organization.

### Optional

- `description` (String) A description of the user.
- `mobile` (String) The mobile phone number of the user.
- `newsletter` (Boolean) Whether the user has opted into the newsletter.
- `notification_enabled` (Boolean) Whether notifications are enabled for the user.
- `phone` (String) The phone number of the user.
- `promotions` (Boolean) Whether the user has opted into promotional communications.
- `require_totp` (Boolean) Whether the user requires TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) for authentication.
- `salesforce_id` (String) The Salesforce ID associated with the user.
- `salutation` (String) The salutation for the user.
- `security_roles` (List of String) List of security roles assigned to the user.

### Read-Only

- `active` (Boolean) Whether the user account is active. This field is computed and cannot be directly modified. User deactivation is handled automatically during resource deletion: users who have logged in (`invitation_pending = false`) will be deactivated rather than deleted when you run `terraform destroy`.
- `channel_manager` (Boolean) Whether the user is a channel manager.
- `confirmation_pending` (Boolean) Whether the user has a pending confirmation.
- `emails` (Attributes List) List of email addresses associated with the user. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--emails))
- `employee_id` (Number) The employee ID of the user.
- `feature_flags` (List of String) List of feature flags enabled for the user.
- `invitation_pending` (Boolean) Whether the user has a pending invitation. Users with a pending invitation cannot be updated in the provider until the invitation has been accepted. **Important for resource deletion**: Users with `invitation_pending = true` can be deleted directly, while users with `invitation_pending = false` (who have logged in) can only be deactivated. When you run `terraform destroy` on a user resource, Terraform will automatically delete users with pending invitations or deactivate users who have already logged in, based on this field.
- `last_updated` (String)
- `mfa_enabled` (Boolean) Whether multi-factor authentication is enabled for the user.
- `name` (String) The full name of the user.
- `party_id` (Number) The party ID of the user.
- `receives_child_notifications` (Boolean) Whether the user receives notifications for child entities.
- `uid` (String) The unique identifier for the user.
- `username` (String) The username for the user.
