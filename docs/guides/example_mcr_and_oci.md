# MCR to OCI
This example provisions a demonstration environment including OCI FastConnect, Megaport MCR and a VXC between OCI FastConnect and MCR. It 
requires account credentials for Megaport and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

This example requires some prior understanding of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure platform.  

# Full Example
This example is split over multiple Terraform files to segregate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Megaport resources.
Use the [Megaport GitHub repository](https://github.com/megaport/terraform-provider-megaport/tree/main/examples/mcr_and_oci_vxcs)
to obtain the full configuration.
